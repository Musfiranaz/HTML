<P><b>Productivity shock</b>
          <p><blockquote>It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the [productivity,output, and employment] trends we are describing are long time trends and were thoroughly evident before 1929.<br/>These trends are in nowise  the result of the present depression,nor are they the result of the World War.On the contrary, the present depression is the collapse resulting from<br/>these long-term trends.</p>
           <p><b>-M.King Hubbert</b></p></blockquote>


<p>The first  three decades of the 20th century saw economic output surge with electrification ,mass production,and motorized farm machinery,and because of the rapid growth in<br/>productivity there was a lot of excess production capacity and the work week was being reduced.</p>
